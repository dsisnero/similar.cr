{"id":"similar-7bf","title":"Implement DiffableStr abstraction for generic text diffing","description":"# Implement DiffableStr Abstraction for Generic Text Diffing\n\n## Problem Statement\nCurrently TextDiff only works with String tokens (Array(String)), but Rust's similar crate supports multiple string-like types via DiffableStr/DiffableStrRef traits. This prevents implementing features like:\n- similar-b07: SliceRemapper utility tests (requires generic text diffing)\n- similar-knq: Bytes support for binary diffing\n- Full inline diff implementation (requires word-level diffing with proper tokenization)\n\nThe core limitation is Crystal's type system: arrays of abstract types are not directly supported, and generic constraints with duck typing require careful design.\n\n## Solution Requirements\n1. DiffableStr interface - Abstract module/class defining required methods:\n   - size : Int - Length in characters/graphemes\n   - [] indexing - Access by character position\n   - slice - Extract substrings\n   - to_s - Convert to String for display\n   - Optional: bytesize, codepoints, etc.\n\n2. Wrapper structs implementing DiffableStr:\n   - StringWrapper - Wraps String (zero-cost abstraction)\n   - BytesWrapper - Wraps Bytes for binary diffing\n   - Future: RopeWrapper, GraphemeWrapper, etc.\n\n3. Generic TextDiff - class TextDiff(T) where T includes DiffableStr\n   - Works with Array(T) instead of Array(String)\n   - Maintains backward compatibility via String specialization\n\n4. Updated infrastructure:\n   - capture_diff_slices in src/common.cr - Generic type support\n   - Algorithms::Myers and Algorithms::Patience - Generic token arrays\n   - TextDiffConfig - Generic constraints\n   - iter_inline_changes - Word-level diffing with proper tokenization\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n### Option 1: Union Types (Simpler)\nalias DiffableStr = String | Bytes\n- Pros: Simple, no wrapper overhead\n- Cons: Type checks at runtime, harder to extend, method dispatch complexity\n\n### Option 2: Wrapper Structs (Recommended)\nmodule DiffableStr\n  abstract def size : Int32\n  abstract def [](index : Int32) : Char\n  abstract def slice(range : Range) : self\n  abstract def to_s : String\nend\n\nstruct StringWrapper\n  include DiffableStr\n  getter str : String\n  # ... implementations\nend\n- Pros: Clean abstraction, extensible, matches Rust pattern\n- Cons: More boilerplate, wrapper overhead (minimal)\n\n### Option 3: Generic Constraints with Duck Typing\nclass TextDiff(T)\n  # T must respond to .size, .[], .slice, .to_s\n- Pros: No wrapper overhead, compile-time checking\n- Cons: Crystal's duck typing limitations, harder to document\n\n## Recommended Approach: Wrapper Structs\nMatches Rust's architecture most closely and provides clear extensibility path.\n\n## Files to Modify/Create\n\n1. src/text/abstraction.cr (new) - DiffableStr module and wrapper structs\n2. src/text/mod.cr - Make TextDiff generic: class TextDiff(T)\n3. src/common.cr - Update capture_diff_slices for generic T\n4. src/iter.cr - Make Diff::Iterator and OpCodeIterator generic\n5. src/text/utils.cr - Update QuickSeqRatio for generic types\n6. spec/text_spec.cr - Add tests with wrapper types\n7. spec/bytes_spec.cr (future) - Bytes diffing tests\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Create DiffableStr abstraction in src/text/abstraction.cr\n2. Implement StringWrapper struct (zero-cost via delegate)\n3. Make TextDiff generic with backward compatibility alias:\n   alias StringTextDiff = TextDiff(StringWrapper)\n4. Update algorithms to work with Array(T) instead of Array(String)\n5. Add conversion helpers:\n   def self.diff_strings(old : String, new : String) : StringTextDiff\n     TextDiff(StringWrapper).new([StringWrapper.new(old)], [StringWrapper.new(new)])\n   end\n6. Update existing tests to use wrapper API\n7. Add comprehensive tests for generic functionality\n\n## Dependencies \u0026 Blocking\n\n- Blocks: similar-b07 (SliceRemapper), similar-knq (Bytes support)\n- Required for: Full inline diff implementation (word-level tokenization)\n- Part of epic: similar-j7m (Test Verification Phase)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Backward compatibility: Existing tests must pass unchanged\n2. Wrapper validation: Test StringWrapper behaves identically to String\n3. Generic functionality: Test TextDiff with custom wrapper types\n4. Performance: Ensure zero/minimal overhead for String case\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] DiffableStr module with abstract methods\n- [ ] StringWrapper struct implementing DiffableStr\n- [ ] Generic TextDiff(T) class\n- [ ] Backward compatibility via String specialization\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests for wrapper functionality\n- [ ] Ready for BytesWrapper implementation (similar-knq)\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n- Risk: Performance regression for String diffs\n  - Mitigation: Use delegate macros, inline wrappers, benchmark comparisons\n- Risk: Complex type signatures throughout codebase\n  - Mitigation: Provide type aliases (StringTextDiff), keep public API simple\n- Risk: Breaking changes to public API\n  - Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility with deprecated methods\n\n## References\n\n- Rust source: src/traits.rs (DiffableStr, DiffableStrRef)\n- Rust source: src/text/ (generic text diffing implementation)\n- Current Crystal: src/text/mod.cr (String-only TextDiff)\n- Issue dependencies: similar-b07, similar-knq","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dsisnero@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-30T02:32:28.785495-07:00","created_by":"dsisnero","updated_at":"2026-01-31T12:39:59.58281-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T12:39:59.58281-07:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
